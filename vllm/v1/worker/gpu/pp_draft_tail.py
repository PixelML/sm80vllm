"""Run the DFlash2 draft tail on an earlier pipeline stage.

Under pipeline parallelism the last stage runs the target's last layers, the
verify lm_head, the rejection sampler, the drafter's layers *and* the drafter's
tail: a second full-vocabulary lm_head pass over the sampled rows (top-k
candidates), the candidate selector and the selector walk. The tail needs no
KV cache, only ``lm_head`` and the selector weights, so it can run on another
stage that has memory to spare and idles while the last stage works
(``VLLM_PP_DRAFT_TAIL_STAGE=<stage>``, default -1 = off).

With the flag on:

* the last stage runs the drafter's layers as before, gathers the sampled rows'
  hidden states plus the per-row inputs of the walk (anchor token, sample
  position, temperature, seed) into one byte buffer (the *payload*), and sends
  it to the tail stage on a dedicated communicator;
* the tail stage runs the same candidate pass, selector and walk on the same
  rows with the same weights (copied from the last stage once, after start-up)
  and becomes the root of the draft-token broadcast for that step;
* the last stage receives the drafts like every other stage and scatters them
  into its request state before a later step reads them.

The draft tokens are bit-identical to the flag-off path: the kernels, their
inputs, the row count (the flag-off path's CUDA-graph padding included) and
the weights are the same. A step falls back to the last stage when the tail
cannot be moved (structured output needs the drafts on the host at once; a
step that samples nothing broadcasts nothing); every stage takes that decision
from the same scheduler output, so the collective order always agrees.

This module holds the pieces that do not need a GPU (gate, payload layout,
the per-step decision, the last stage's pending-draft queue) plus the tail
module a tail stage builds.
