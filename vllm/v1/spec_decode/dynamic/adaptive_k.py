"""Acceptance-adaptive speculative draft count (host-side).

Picks the number of draft tokens to *verify* per scheduler step from an
exponential moving average of how many drafts each running request has
recently had accepted. Everything here is pure Python running on the
scheduler's CPU thread: nothing is trimmed on the device, so it composes with
attention backends (e.g. the DSA indexer) that reject vLLM's device-side
``enable_adaptive_verification``.

Because decode runs under uniform-batch full CUDA graphs, the choice is made
once per step for the whole batch (a low quantile over the per-request EMAs,
so no request in the batch is over-drafted), and the result is snapped to the
set of draft counts that have captured graphs.
